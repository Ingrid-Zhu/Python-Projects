\f0\fs24 \cf0 I added sound feature to the game. Three different sounds from the source codes are added when aliens collide with player\'92s bolt, the ship collides with the bolt from alien, and every time the player fire a bolt. I loaded the three sounds at the beginning of the wave as a list of background music (bgm) and adjust their volume at the same time and I play each sound in corresponding methods (_collision and _ShBolt). The bgm list was constructed in a similar way as the ALIEN_IMAGE. I added an attribute _bgmstop in Wave to track the silent mode of the game, and add to key press \'93F\'94 and \'93O\'94 for players to turn the sound feature on and off accordingly.}
